# Walton Parkman - Odoo Services Website

This is a professional website for Walton Parkman's Odoo customization and app development services using AI.

## Website Overview

The website includes:
- A modern, responsive design
- Sections for services, about, and contact information
- Information about AI-powered Odoo customization services

## Local Development

To test the website locally, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
# Navigate to the website directory
cd C:\Users\Boss\CascadeProjects\waltonparkman-website

# Start a simple HTTP server (Python 3)
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then access the website at http://localhost:8000

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Squarespace

Since you purchased the domain through Squarespace, you have several options:

1. **Use Squarespace's Website Builder:**
   - Log in to your Squarespace account
   - Replace their templates with your custom code using the "Custom Code" injection feature
   - This may have limitations depending on your Squarespace plan

2. **External Hosting with Domain Pointing:**
   - Host your website files on a service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or a traditional web host
   - Configure your Squarespace domain to point to your hosting provider
   - Follow Squarespace's documentation for "Domain Pointing" or "Custom Domain Setup"

### Option 2: GitHub Pages

Since you already have a GitHub account (https://github.com/waltonparkman), you can use GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository named `waltonparkman.github.io`
2. Push your website files to this repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings
4. Configure your custom domain in GitHub Pages settings

### Option 3: Traditional Web Hosting

1. Sign up with a web hosting provider (e.g., Bluehost, HostGator, etc.)
2. Upload your website files via FTP
3. Configure your Squarespace domain to point to your hosting provider

## Connecting Your Domain

Regardless of which hosting option you choose:

1. Log in to your Squarespace account
2. Navigate to Domains > waltonparkman.com > DNS Settings
3. Follow the instructions for your specific hosting provider to set up the correct DNS records
4. Changes may take 24-48 hours to propagate
